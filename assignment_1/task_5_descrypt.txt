Cybersecurity, computer security or IT security is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, 
software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
Cybersecurity includes controllingphysical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access,
data and code injection.
Also, due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional or accidental,
IT security is susceptible to being tricked into deviating from secure procedures through various methods.
The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet,
wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones,
televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things.
